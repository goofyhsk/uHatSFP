Re-Interpretation of 'PiHat SFP "encoder"' by PcDwarf - https://hackaday.io/project/21725-pihat-sfp-encoder [^1]  


>This project is a small PCB "piHat" design to interface the I2C bus of SFP and SFP+ modules with a raspberry Pi.

Mine will be recreated (for fun / to learn) with my [uHAT](https://github.com/goofyhsk/uHat) base.  
This should also be compatible with full size Pi  

Note: since there is no EEPROM it can't be called a HAT :)

I intend to include gerbers for various SFP Cage models, with both SMT and TH HAT bases.  
I am also adding a secondary 4P Header for ability to use (i2c) without a RPi
